CS 255 System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DrivePass project is a web-based application for Liam, the client; wants to be able to set up driving courses and tests to students to be able to pass. 

What did you do particularly well?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose my diagrams from the system design phase. I would improve adding more functions and better interactions between them.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are very important to conside when designing, this would ensure the success of the software or application and increase the learning to other students, otherwise the application would fail.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to desiging the software was based on personal interactions. I ran scenarios of similar software and thought; "How is this implemented? and for what purpose?" I thought about potential issues, and how can these issues be resolved? I would implement the same approach and strategies, but I would also use another developer to get a more unbiased opinion in the future.
